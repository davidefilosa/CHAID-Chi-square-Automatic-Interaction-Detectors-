What will we do in this project?
In this project we will analyze what drives the choice of recruiters to call back candidates and we will also try to understand if having an ethnic name lowers the probability of being called back.

To do this we will use Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID).

CHAID is a decision tree technique used to discover the relationship between variables.

We can do both drive analysis to understand what matters the most and segmentation. CHAID is different from other segmentation techniques which have only independent variables while CHAID also has a dependent variable.

In practice, CHAID is often used in the context of direct marketing to select groups of consumers to predict how their responses to some variables affect other variables.
